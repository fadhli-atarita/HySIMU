Do not use apostrophe/quotation marks to write paths, names, and other inputs.

Parameter guides:
(start at 2, to match the line in the excel file)
2. project_directory_path > (str) directory path to run the simulation in. all input files 
				should be added into this directory.
3. output_directory_path > (str) path to the output directory to store all output files 
				and temporary albedo files for libradtran computation. 
4. project_name > (str) this will be used to differentiate simulations and name all the outputs.
5. platform_type > (str) type of remote sensing platform. "satellite", "aircraft", "uav". 
			will impact the sensor altitude.
6. platform_or_sensor_identifier > (str) platform or sensor name for identifier, if any.
7. processing_cores > (int) number of cores to run the scripts. has to be the same as in the 
			slurm file. 64 or more is recommended.
8. joblib_verbose_level > (int) joblib tracking. 0 means no tracking output. >0 prints tracking
				output. higher verbose level may affect running time.
9. spectral_map_pixel_resolution_in_m > (float) spatial resolution of the input spectral map 
					or the random spectral map in meter
					(ground truth resolution).
10. sensor_spatial_resolution_in_m > (float) the spatial resolution of the sensor in meter
11. spectral_map_file > (str) path to the input spectral distribution map file. can be either a 
				.mat v7.3 file or a .npy file. set it to "random" if a 
				random distribution map from a randomly generated fractal field
				is desired or "dem_based_fractal" to create spectral zones
				from delienating the DEM file.
12. spectral_map_complexity_level > (float) complexity level of the distribution map. a float
					starting from 0 (high complexity). complexity will 
					decrease as this value increases.
13. spectral_map_randomness_offset_factor > (float) randomizers, so that the same DEM file can 
						produce difference discretization, if desired for
						sensitivity studies. set to 0 if equal binning
						is desired: this means that the same DEM file
						will always produce the same spectral zones.
						otherwise set to a float value [0,1].
14. number_of_endmembers > (int) a value greater than 0. number of spectra in the spectra file 
				or the desired number of spectral zones in the distribution map.
				required for both "random" or prescribed distribution map.
15. number_of_subregions > (int) number of subregions that corresponds to the number of spectra
				synthetisized (spectral texture). if no texture is desired,
				set this parameter to 1. otherwise, set it to any other
				positive integer. The higher, the more "textured" the datacube
				will look. recommended value is a quarter of the minimum
				dimension size of the spectral map or DEM.

				should contain a list of fwhm values the same dimension as the

			map. an input spectral map cannot be combined with a "random" DEM.
25. DEM_maximum_altitude > (float) maximum point altitude in the DEM. only if parameter 24 is set
				to "random". otherwise, set it to "none". recommended 
				values: 5% of max map dimension.

					variance nugget of the generated random field that represents
					the "spatial texture" of the image. the number of elements
					in the list  must correspond to the number of endmembers
					(parameter 14). Higher value means noisier texture. 
					if parameter 15 is set to 1, this parameter will not have any
 					effect. default value is 0.05 and recommended value is 0.01.
					be advised that this parameter will make the datacube look
					'noisy' unless parameter 15 is set to 1.
27. add_spectral_statistical_texture > (str) "yes" or "no". provides option to add the 'texture'
					to the datacube. if set to no, it overrides all other texture
